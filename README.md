If you are interested in working with these colors (maybe also use them in other
apps in macOS), you can import the color palette `LesCouleurs.clr` into your
color library.

Steps to import the color palette (assuming you cloned or downloaded this
repository):

1) Open the *Finder* on MacOS
2) Click *Go* in the menu bar
3) Hold down the *Option*-key (or *Alt*-key); a menu entry "Library" should
appear - click it
4) Locate the folder "Colors" and open it
5) Paste the `LesCouleurs.clr` in that folder

## Installation
- In the terminal app, go to _Preferences_ (or hit `[command]+[,]`)
- Below the other available colorschemes (i.e. *Basic*, *Grass*, *Novel*...)
  click the cogs-icon and chose _Import..._
- Locate the file `lescouleurs.terminal` on your filesystem and click _Open_
